Requirements: python 3.8.2(latest release)
Note: virtualenv is recommended but not required
Installation:
1. Clone the git repo into a desired folder
2. Open a console and type the command
        pip install django
   If it says pip isn't a recognized command, you need to add the python commands
   to the PATH environment variable.  Easiest way is to do a custom (re)install of 
   python and check the box that say like "add to path"
3. If you want to use the virtualenv, use the command
        pip install virtualenv
4. To activate the environment, run the commands below from the same folder you 
   cloned the repo into
        virtualenv env
        source env/Scripts/activate
   The first command sets up the env directory, which is only done once, and the 
   second is the what starts the environment, which needs to be don each time a
   command window is opened.  The command "deactivate" will close the environment

Models are used to interact with the data and deal with any data logic involved
Views are the different ways data is displayed to a user
Controllers handle user requests and are what link the model and the View
